# SQL_Bicycle_Manufacture_Analysis

##  **1. Introduction and Motivation**

The AdventureWorks2019 dataset, originally designed for SQL Server, provides a comprehensive representation of a fictional manufacturing and retail company, Adventure Works Cycles, which sells bicycles and cycling accessories.

By analyzing this dataset in Google BigQuery, a cloud-based data warehouse, we can leverage high-performance SQL queries to extract actionable business insights efficiently. This analysis allows us to explore key areas such as sales trends, customer behavior, inventory management, and financial performance.

Through this analysis, we focus on key business metrics such as sales trends, customer retention, inventory levels, and regional performance. Our objectives include:

- Sales Performance Analysis
- Growth Trends (YoY) growth rates
